# Hi there! 👋 I'm PointyBytes.

I'm a Python enthusiast currently teetering on the edge of beginner to intermediate programmer status. Picture me as a curious explorer navigating the vast expanse of the coding universe, often finding myself lost amidst the realms of Python wizardry and Raspberry Pi alchemy. Oh, and did I mention I'm gaslighting myself into believing I'm a game developer? 🎮

🐍 Python enthusiast? Absolutely! From scripts that hum (well, kind of) to those still finding their groove, I'm here for it all.

🎲 When I'm not tinkering with code or my beloved Raspberry Pi (I've been a fan since its first breath!), you'll catch me deep in the world of role-playing games. Whether I'm the mastermind behind the scenes or just rolling the dice, it's all about crafting epic tales.

🃏 And board games? Oh, they're another passion! Especially if it's a co-op game, or better yet, a legacy co-op game where we can all bask in our collective glory (or, occasionally, facepalm together).

📚 Currently channeling my energy into a [Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course. A certificate looms on the horizon, but it's not just about learning; it's about conquering personal and technical challenges.

💻 Also, I'm excited about my plans to write an [Evennia](https://github.com/evennia/evennia)-based MUD inspired by one of my favorite [TTRPGs](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/mutant-year-zero/). Currently, I'm tinkering with [python-tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod), exploring the realms of roguelike game development.

Let's dive into the code together and see where this journey takes us!
